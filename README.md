# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
*Comprehensive data analysis and visualization of UK road accident casualties (2021-2022)*

---

## Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of road accident data for 2021-2022, designed to support evidence-based decision-making for road safety stakeholders. By examining casualty patterns across severity, vehicle type, location, and temporal factors, the analysis provides actionable insights to reduce accidents and improve public safety outcomes.

## Business Objectives

**Primary KPIs**
- Track total casualties and accidents with year-over-year growth analysis  
- Monitor casualty distribution by accident severity with comparative trending  
- Analyze vehicle type contribution to overall casualty figures  

**Secondary KPIs**
- Establish monthly casualty trends comparing current and previous year performance  
- Identify casualty patterns by road type, urban/rural classification, and day/night occurrence  
- Map geographic distribution of accidents and casualties by location

## Methodology

### Data Processing & Quality Assurance
- **Data Source:** UK road accident dataset covering 2021-2022  
- **Tools Used:** Power BI for visualization, PowerPoint for dashboard design, Excel for data validation  
- **Data Cleaning:** Systematic validation, outlier detection, and missing value treatment  
- **Quality Controls:** Data integrity checks and standardization of categorical variables  

### Analytical Framework
1. Requirement gathering with stakeholders to define KPIs  
2. Exploratory data analysis across all variables  
3. Time series analysis for temporal patterns  
4. Year-over-year comparative analysis  
5. Geographic analysis of high-risk areas  
6. Data modeling for optimized dashboard functionality

## Key Insights

### Overall Performance Trends
- **Total Casualties (CY):** 195.7K (↓11.9% YoY)  
- **Total Accidents (CY):** 144.4K (↓11.7% YoY)  
- **Severity Breakdown**  
  - Fatal casualties: 2.9K (↓33.3% YoY)  
  - Serious casualties: 27.0K (↓16.2% YoY)  
  - Slight casualties: 165.8K (↓10.6% YoY)  

### Vehicle Category Risk Analysis
- Cars: 155,804 casualties (major contributor)  
- Vans: 15,905 casualties  
- Motorcycles (Bikes): 15,610 casualties  
- Buses: 6,573 casualties  
- Agricultural Vehicles: 399 casualties  
- Other Vehicles: 1,446 casualties  

### Temporal and Geographic Patterns
- **Monthly Trend:** 2021 recorded higher peaks (notably in autumn) compared to 2022. A visible decline is observed toward the end of 2022.  
- **Day vs Night:** 73.84% of casualties occurred during the day, while 26.16% occurred at night.  
- **Urban vs Rural:** Urban areas accounted for 61.95% of casualties, while rural areas accounted for 38.05%.  
- **Road Type:**  
  - Single carriageways: 145K casualties  
  - Dual carriageways: 32K casualties  
  - Roundabouts: 13K casualties  
  - One-way streets: 3K casualties  
  - Slip roads: 3K casualties

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Action Items
- Strengthen safety infrastructure in **urban areas**, where ~62% of casualties occur.  
- Focus on **daytime driving risks**, which account for nearly three-quarters of incidents.  
- Develop targeted interventions for **car and motorcycle users**, the largest contributing categories.  

### Medium-Term Initiatives
- Conduct safety audits of **single carriageway roads**, which account for the majority of casualties.  
- Implement localized safety measures in high-density regions identified on the geographic heatmap.  
- Monitor seasonal trends to sustain reductions observed at year-end.  

### Long-Term Policy Development
- Develop specialized safety standards for **agricultural and commercial vehicles**.  
- Establish an integrated road safety framework involving multiple stakeholders.  

---

## Business Impact
The analysis reveals measurable progress in road safety, with double-digit declines across all severity categories and a 33.3% reduction in fatal casualties year-over-year. The findings highlight critical focus areas, including urban zones, daytime driving conditions, and single carriageway roads.  

These insights support evidence-based policymaking and efficient resource allocation, contributing to sustainable improvements in road safety.
