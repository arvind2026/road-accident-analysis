# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard - Data Analyst Experience

## Project Overview
Led a comprehensive road accident analysis project to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard covering 2021-2022 data. The project aimed to provide actionable insights to government agencies and transport authorities for improving road safety policies.

## Key Responsibilities & Process

=> Data Collection & Assessment :

- Analyzed raw dataset containing road accident records with multiple parameters including date, location, vehicle type, accident severity, and casualty information
- Conducted initial data quality assessment and identified key data cleaning requirements
- Collaborated with stakeholders from Ministry of Transport, Police Force, and Emergency Services to understand reporting needs

=> Data Preparation & Modeling :

- Connected and imported large datasets into Power BI from multiple sources
- Performed extensive data cleaning to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting issues
- Created calculated fields and measures for year-over-year comparisons and KPI calculations
- Developed data model with proper relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Built time intelligence functions for monthly trending and comparative analysis

=> Dashboard Development :

- Designed custom background layouts in PowerPoint for professional dashboard appearance
- Created interactive visualizations including area charts, bar charts, and KPI cards
- Implemented drill-down capabilities for location-based analysis
- Built dynamic filters for vehicle type, road type, and time period selections
- Developed responsive dashboard layout suitable for different screen sizes

=> Analysis & Insights Generation :

- Calculated primary KPIs: Total casualties (169.4K) and accidents (125.4K) with YoY growth rates
- Analyzed casualty trends by severity levels (Fatal: 2,567, Serious: 23.9K, Slight: 143K)
- Performed vehicle type analysis showing cars accounted for 79% of total casualties
- Conducted geographical analysis identifying Birmingham as highest risk area with 4,096 casualties
- Analyzed temporal patterns revealing 75% of accidents occur during daytime hours


## Key Findings & Impact

=> Performance Metrics Delivered :

- Overall 11.17% decrease in casualties compared to previous year
- 30.98% reduction in fatal casualties - significant safety improvement
- Identified urban areas account for 62% of all casualties, requiring targeted interventions

=> Strategic Insights Provided :

- Peak accident months identified (September 2021: 16,965 vs June 2022: 15,829)
- Single carriageways emerged as highest risk road type with 125,513 casualties
- Rural vs urban casualty distribution analysis (38% rural, 62% urban)
- Day/night analysis showing clear daytime accident concentration

=> Recommendations Delivered :
- Prioritized urban safety measures based on 62% casualty concentration
- Suggested car-specific safety campaigns given 134K+ car-related casualties
- Recommended city-specific interventions for top 5 high-risk locations
- Proposed enhanced single carriageway safety measures


## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Power BI : Advanced dashboard creation, DAX calculations, data modeling
- Data Analysis : Statistical analysis, trend identification, comparative analysis
- Data Cleaning : Handling large datasets, quality assurance, validation
- Stakeholder Management : Requirements gathering, presentation of findings
- Data Visualization : Creating clear, actionable charts and KPIs for executive audiences

## Business Impact
The dashboard enabled government agencies to make data-driven decisions for road safety policies. The analysis directly supported resource allocation decisions and helped identify priority areas for safety interventions, contributing to the observed 11% reduction in overall casualties.

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Primary platform)
- PowerPoint (Background design)
